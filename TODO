- test every options
- test cmd_des I/O robustness (does it work well with the -a option and with
  different types of intput like stdin or an arbitrary files, and handle edge
  cases too)
- think about closing the readfile fd when leaving on error
- handle I/O errors and print corresponding messages
- change 'help' option or documentation so that they match because right
  now '-help' is documented where only '-h' can be used
- clean the cmdf directory (even delete it and create multiple sub directories)
- write the other commands
- make the cli parsing great again
